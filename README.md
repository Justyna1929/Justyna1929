### About me
---

My name is Justyna and I'm from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, currently living in China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

I am an inspiring Data Analyst, and master of Landscape Architecture. After graduating from university, my life took a decidedly different course. Currently, I am in the process of changing my working profile. I am interested in data analytics, especially in data visualization, which I notice is very similar what I already did in my university. 

The ability to learn quickly, patience and independence allow me to find myself in a world full of data!
